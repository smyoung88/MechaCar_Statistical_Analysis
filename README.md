## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. They have significant impact on miles per gallon. There is a significant amount of variablility in the dependent variables when all independent variables are equal to zero.

Since the p-value is less than the significance leel (0.05), we cannot accept the null hypothesis.
